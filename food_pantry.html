    <p>The Food Pantry not only offers food, but also common household and kitchen items. There are food untensils, pots, pans, tupperware, and other kitchenware that the Pantry provides. In addition, it provides common household items such as trash bags, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, and more. However, there is a limited supply of personal, household, and cookware items so you are encouraged to shopping cookware once a semester and personal needs to once a month. Here is a list of the items they provide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>School Supplies</li>
        <li>Hygiene Products</li>
        <li>Produce</li>
        <li>Dairy</li>
